factions vs nations




playerview dropdowns all need changing to choose from the nations rather than factions (players are nations! factions are teams!)
setup nations should begin with none selected (its just easier than having to uncheck them all)
platoons seem to currently be set at the faction level rather than the nation level. 
player orderpanel/tab needs the order wiring. 
diplomacy/ resource sharing and strategy links need wiring
factions command needs to only be available if the player is in a faction. if they arent then it should just list available factions and "send request"



- after a battle is resolved. the losing players platoon/s which lost would need to move/fallback to one of their adjacent territories.

- platoon tab should show all players platoons. clicking them should higlight their marker on the map. it currently is set based on clicking territories 

- orderstab available orders need wiring up so they are actually playable.
